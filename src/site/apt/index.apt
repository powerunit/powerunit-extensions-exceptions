PowerUnit Extension Async

 This library provides support for async operation in x-unit test. The idea is
 to do a static import from <<<ch.powerunit.extensions.async.lang.WaitResult>>> and
 then use the various methods to start some asynchronous operations.
 
 This version is dedicated to Java 9. Multi-version jar (supporting java 8) is available 
 since version 1.1.0
